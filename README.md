# sing4me

Most sight singing tools are shitty:
not interactive
hard to use
not fun at all

The products must be:
fun to use
very easy to use
obvious in their function and features
interactive
one-click installs
down the road: online widget
not look or seem like a MaxMSP patch, at all (intimidating to many people!)

First product:
You pick a key: 
You tell it: major or harmonic minor
It plays a warm-up tonicization cadence.   
It tells you: your note in movable do solfege, color-coded according to some existing pedagogical system perhaps?
Chord being played back: Tonic, Dominant, Sub-Dominant
